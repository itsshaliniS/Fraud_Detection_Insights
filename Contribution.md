## 📐 Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines:

```python
# Good ✅
def calculate_default_rate(data):
    """
    Calculate the default rate from loan data.
    
    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): Loan dataset
        
    Returns:
        float: Default rate as a percentage
    """
    default_count = data[data['loan_status'] == 'Charged Off'].shape[0]
    total_count = data.shape[0]
    return (default_count / total_count) * 100

# Bad ❌
def calc(d):
    return (d[d['loan_status']=='Charged Off'].shape[0]/d.shape[0])*100
```

### Jupyter Notebook Guidelines

1. **Cell Organization**:
   - One logical operation per cell
   - Clear markdown headers for sections
   - Comments explaining complex operations

2. **Code Cleanliness**:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Clear all outputs before committing (optional)
   - Use meaningful variable names

3. **Visualization Standards**:
   ```python
   # Include titles, labels, and legends
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
   plt.title('Default Rate by Employment Length', fontsize=14)
   plt.xlabel('Employment Length', fontsize=12)
   plt.ylabel('Default Rate (%)', fontsize=12)
   plt.legend()
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where applicable
- Add screenshots for visual features
- Keep formatting consistent
