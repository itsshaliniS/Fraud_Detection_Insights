## General Information
- EDA for the Lending Club Loan dataset to find the driving patterns, and variables for the defaulters
- We aim to identify the patterns to help the financial institutions mitigate the risk of financial loss by knowing the factors of defaulters
- The loan dataset is analysed which contains the information of the borrowers combined of defaulters, fully paid and current. We mainly analyse the patterns related to Defaulters.



## Conclusions
- Employment Length: Borrowers with longer employment lengths, especially greater than 10 years, have a higher likelihood of default.
- Home Ownership: Individuals with home ownership categorized as "Rent" and "Mortgage" are more prone to default.
- Loan Purpose: Loans with the purpose of "Debt Consolidation" tend to have a higher rate of charge-off.
- State: Certain states, such as California, Florida, New York, and New Jersey, have a higher incidence of loan default.
- Loan Term: Shorter loan terms (36 months) have a higher default rate compared to longer terms (60 months).
- Interest Rate: Borrowers with higher interest rates (between 13%-17%) are at a greater risk of default.
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Higher DTI values, particularly in the range of 12-18, are associated with more charged-off accounts.
- Annual Income: Borrowers with annual incomes between 27K - 77K tend to default more frequently.
- Revolving Utilization Rate: Higher revolving utilization rates are linked to a higher likelihood of default.
